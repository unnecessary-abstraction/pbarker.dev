Abstract
--------

Open Source license compliance is a concern for any company which distributes
systems containing the Linux kernel and other copyleft-licensed components. The
Yocto Project, a widely used Embedded Linux toolkit including the OpenEmbedded
build system, contains many tools to help companies achieve license compliance.
Output from a Yocto Project build can also be fed into other license compliance
software such as Fossology. In this talk Paul will explore these tools, address
how best to configure & connect them and discuss current best practices. Paul
will explore how modern programming languages such as Go, Javascript and Rust
cause license compliance headaches due to their separate package managers and
how to resolve these issues. He will show how to handle common concerns such as
commercially licensed media codecs and GPLv3 licensed software components. He
will also bring the audience up to date with the latest developments and ongoing
work in this area of the Yocto Project.

This talk will cover technical best practices and available tools, it will not
give legal advice.
