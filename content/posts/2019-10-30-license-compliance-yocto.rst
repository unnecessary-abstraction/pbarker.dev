Abstract
--------

If you distribute a product which runs an Embedded, Linux-based software stack
then you have obligations to fulfil under the GPL and other open source
licenses. Thankfully, the Yocto Project provides tooling to help you achieve
this.

Paul will present the current state of the license compliance tools in the Yocto
Project and show how they are used. Paul will also discuss best practices,
pitfalls to avoid, methods of integration with other license compliance software
such as Fossology and where to get further information on these subjects. For
those already familiar with these tools, this presentation will point out recent
improvements and suggest areas for future development. A comparison with tools
provided by other Embedded Linux build systems will also be given so that our
projects can learn from each other. Focus will be given to how small teams can
use these tools effectively, however the content will also be relevant to larger
organisations. No legal advice will be given.
