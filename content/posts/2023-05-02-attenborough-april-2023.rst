Attenborough Nature Reserve in April 2023

:summary: Photos taken at `Attenborough Nature Reserve
  <https://www.nottinghamshirewildlife.org/attenborough>`__, Nottingham, UK, in
  the month of April 2023.

My interest in wildlife photography has built up slowly over the past 2 years. I
suppose it's a consequence of the pandemic and lockdowns, I began to explore my
local area more and connect with the wildlife. And most recently, I've grown
very fond of `Attenborough Nature Reserve
<https://www.nottinghamshirewildlife.org/attenborough>`__ which is just a short
journey from home for me. I visited twice in April, here's some of my favourite
photos from those visits.

You can find more of my photography on `Pixelfed

This was a relatively short walk around the reserve with my partner, so I didn't
spend too much time running off with my camera. My favourite discovery of the
day was the quality of the bacon sandwiches in the visitors' centre.

This time I went to the reserve on my own so was much more focused on the
wildlife and my photography. I spent most of my time in one of the bird hides on
the site but saw little of interest to photograph from there. My best photos of
the day actually came from the vicinity of the car park (the duck, the swan and
the curious moorhen).

   This was quite a friendly swan - I was able to get really close to it without
   getting hissed at.

   This moorhen looked at me curiously for just a second before running off!

I really enjoyed both these visits and I'm going to see if I can make this a
regular thing. Perhaps there will be another Attenborough Nature Reserve post
next month...
