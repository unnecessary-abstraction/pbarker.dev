Abstract
--------

If you distribute a product that runs an open source software stack such as
Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) then you have obligations to fulfill under the GPL
and other open source licenses. Thankfully, AGL is built upon the Yocto Project
which provides tooling to help you achieve this.

Paul will present an overview of the license compliance tools available to users
of AGL and show how they can be used. Paul will highlight best practices to
follow and potential pitfalls to avoid. Paul will discuss how to handle modern
programming languages such as Go, Javascript, and Rust and how to deal with
common concerns such as commercially licensed media codecs and GPLv3 licensed
software components. He will also bring the audience up to date with the latest
developments and ongoing upstream work in Yocto Project which will be available
to AGL users in the future. This talk will not give legal advice.
