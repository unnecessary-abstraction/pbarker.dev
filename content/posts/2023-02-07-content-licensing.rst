:summary: For my photography and writing I'm now using the
          `Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 (CC-BY-NC 4.0)
          <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/>`_ license. I'll
          continue to release software under open source licenses.

At the start of 2023 I had a bit of a re-think on how I should license the
writing and photographs which I publish to the internet.

There are well established benefits for allowing free commercial use of free and
open source software. But I don't see that the same benefits exist for allowing
free commercial re-use of stories, articles, photos, music, painting, etc. These
things typically have one primary author or group of authors and it's rare to
get significant free contributions (or even want significant contributions) from
companies that want to use your work.

In open source software, we have a mixed history of companies exploiting the
commons and companies contributing back to the commons. For more "artistic"
works, the history seems to be exclusively of companies exploiting the commons.

For these reasons, I'm now allowing only non-commercial use of my photography
and writing by default. In particular, I'm using the
`Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 (CC-BY-NC 4.0)
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/>`_ license.

I'm open to selling commercial re-use licenses for my photos and articles if any
company does express interest. I'm also open to contributing content to existing
projects under other licenses which do allow commercial use where there is a
clear benefit to the commons.

For software projects, I'll continue to use and recommend open source licenses.
My preference is for the `Apache 2.0
<https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ license for source code and the
`Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY 4.0)
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ license for documentation.
