Well, I've been pretty quiet here the last couple of months....

Back in July, I started a new job as an Open Source Specialist at Renesas
Electronics. I'm working on improving support for Renesas processors and boards
in the Linux kernel, U-boot and other open source projects. I really enjoyed my
time with SanCloud, but it was time to move on after working with them for over
4.5 years in different capacities.

Then in September, I moved up to Leeds with my partner. This was rather
stressful, but ultimately an excellent move. I'm enjoying being back in the
North! Our home in Nottingham was pretty well located for green space, but we
have even more woodland, hills and wildlife around us here.

...Wildlife like this hedgehog who probably shouldn't have been out on the
street in daylight - but don't worry! With the help of a neighbour we made
sure he was ok.

It's definitely not summer any more! But things are slowly settling into a new
routine now, so maybe I'll find time to write some more. I have no shortage of
thoughts taking up space in my head so I suppose I should use them for
something!
