    I've long wanted to make an index of the coference talks and papers which
    I've delivered over the years.  After a few experiments, I've settled on a

I've long wanted to make an index of the coference talks and papers which I've
delivered over the years.  After a few experiments, I've settled on a simple and
pretty obvious way to keep an index - I now have a post on this site for each
talk I've given and they can all be found under the `conference-talk tag`_.
Where available, I've included the abstract, slides and video recording for each
talk.

And since this site now contains several different types of content, I've also
added a `blog tag`_ which can be used to browse just the blog posts. Each tag
has its own RSS and ATOM feed, so you can subscribe to individual content types
or topics if you wish to.
